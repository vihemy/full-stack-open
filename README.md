# full-stack-open

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises in the [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course offered by University of Helsinki.

The Full Stack Open course teaches modern web development using JavaScript-based technologies such as React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, and TypeScript.

## Course content

### Part 0: Fundamentals of Web apps

- Covering the basics of web development and the advancements in web application development over the past few decades.

### Part 1: Introduction to React

- Getting familiar with React and writing code that runs in the browser. The part also explores important JavaScript features essential for understanding React.

### Part 2: Communicating with server

- Continuing the React introduction. Covers data rendering, data submit with HTML forms, fetching remote server data, and basic CSS.

### Part 3: Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

- Focuses on the backend. Implement a simple REST API in Node.js using the Express library, with data stored in MongoDB. Finally, the application is deployed to the internet.

### Part 4: Testing Express servers, user administration

- Continuing backend work. Covers writing unit and integration tests and implementing user authentication and authorization.

### Part 5: Testing React apps

- Returning to the frontend, this part covers testing React code and implementing token-based authentication to enable user login.

### Part 6: Advanced state management

- Moving state management outside React components. Introduces Redux for app state, along with React's context and useReducer hooks, and React Query for server state management.

### Part 7: React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack

- Introducing React Router for view navigation based on URL. Exploring additional CSS styling methods, configuring Webpack for custom toolchain setup, and defining custom hooks.

### Part 8: GraphQL

- This part of the course is about GraphQL, Facebook's alternative to REST for communication between browser and server.

### Part 9: TypeScript

- Focuses on TypeScript. Using previously introduced tools, features are built into an existing ecosystem, writing TypeScript with predefined linters and codebase.
